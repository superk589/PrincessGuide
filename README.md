## How to localize
By now, **Hatsune's Notes** provides Chinese and English localization fully, and Japanese partially.  
If you want to localize the app, please goto `./Localizations/PrincessGuide/` and edit the .xliff files.  
If you want to add a new language please tell me.  
For developers only, if you have macOS and Xcode, please read `./Localizations/README.md` and use those scripts to export or import localization.  
Most of the Japanese localizations are done by CaiMiao and Vibbit.
